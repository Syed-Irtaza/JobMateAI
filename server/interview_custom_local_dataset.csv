DSA,"Q2) 

we will call a sequence of integers a spike if they first increase (strictly) and  decrease (also strictly, including the last element of the increasing part). for example (4, 5, 7, 6, 3, 2) is a spike, but (1, 1, 5, 4, 3) and (1, 4, 3, 5) are not. note t the increasing and decreasing parts always intersect, e.g.: for spike (3, 5, 2) sequence (3, 5) is an increasing part and sequence (5, 2) is a decreasing part, and for spike (2) sequence (2) is both an increasing and a decreasing part. your are given an array a of n integers.

your task is to calculate the length of the longest possible spike, which can be created from numbers from array a. note t you are not supposed to find the longest spike as a sub-sequence of a, but rather choose some numbers from a and reorder them to create the longest spike. write a function: def solution(a) which, given an array a of integers of length n, returns the length of the longest spike which can be created from the numbers from a. examples: 1. given a = [1, 2], your  function should return 2, because (1, 2) is already a spike. 2. given a = [2, 5, 3, 2, 4, 1], your function should return 6, because we can create the following spike of length 6: (2, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1). 3. given a = [2, 3, 3, 2, 2, 2, 1], your function should return 4, because we can create the following spike of length 4: (2, 3, 2, 1) and we cannot create any longer spike. note t increasing and decreasing parts should be strictly increasing/decreasing and they always intersect. write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions: n is an integer win the range [1..100,000]; each element of array a is an integer win the range [1..1,000,000].",,,Careem Codility

HR/Behavioral,"Q1) array a consisting of n integers is given. a slice of t array is a pair of integers (p, q) such t 0 ≤ p ≤ q < n. a slice (p, q) of an array a is called non-negative if all the elements a[p], a[p+1], ..., a[q−1], a[q] are non-negative. the sum of a slice (p, q) of array a is the value a[p] + a[p+1] + ... + a[q−1] + a[q]. for example, the following array a: a[0] = 1 a[1] = 2 a[2] = -3 a[3] = 4 a[4] = 5 a[5] = -6 has non-negative slices (0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4) and (3, 4). the sum of slice (0, 1) is a[0] + a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3. the sum of slice (3, 4) is a[3] + a[4] = 4 + 5 = 9. the sum of slice (4, 4) is a[4] = 5. 

  you are given an implementation of a function: def solution(a) t, given an array a consisting of n integers, returns the maximum sum of any non-negative slice in s array. the function returns −1 if there are no non-negative slices in the array. for example, given the following array a: a[0] = 1 a[1] = 2 a[2] = -3 a[3] = 4 a[4] = 5 a[5] = -6 the function should return 9, as explained above.     

        the attached code is still incorrect for some inputs. despite the error(s), the code may produce a correct answer for the example test cases. the goal of the exercise is to find and fix the bug(s) in the implementation. you can modify at most three lines. assume t: n is an integer win the range [0..1,000]; each element of array a is an integer win the range [−1,000..1,000]. in your solution, focus on correctness. code is given below..",,,Careem Codility
